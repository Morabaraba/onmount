# onmount

**Run something when a DOM element appears and when it exits.**

Onmount is a a safe, reliable, idempotent, and testable way to attach JavaScript behaviors to DOM nodes. Perfect for simple (non-SPA) websites. jQuery is optional.

See [rsjs][rsjs] (Reasonable System for JavaScript Structure) for more info on how this is useful.

## Example

This example defines a block of code to be applied to all `.push-button` instances, and another block of code when it's been removed.

```js
$.onmount = require('onmount')

$.onmount('.push-button', function () {
  // on enter
  $(this).on('click', function () { alert('working...') })
}, function () {
  // on exit (optional)
  alert('button was removed')
})
```

Then call `$.onmount()` everytime your code changes. The behavior will be applied once ([and only once][idempotent]) per instance, even if *onmount()* is called multiple times.

```js
document.body.innerHTML =
  '<button class="push-button">Do something</button>'

$.onmount()

$(".push-button").click()  //=> 'working...'
```

Cleanups will be performed when `$.onmount()` is called again but the element is no longer attached.

```js
document.body.innerHTML = ''
$.onmount()  //=> 'button was removed'
```

## Usage

```
npm install rstacruz/onmount
bower install rstacruz/onmount
```

* **With CommonJS/AMD:**<br>
  Great with [Browserify].

  ```js
  $.onmount = require('onmount')
  ```

* **With no module loaders:**<br>
  If it's loaded after jQuery, it's loaded as a jQuery plugin (`$.onmount`).

  ```js
  window.onmount(...)   // no jQuery
  $.onmount(...)        // with jquery
  ```

* **With jQuery:**<br>
  Call `$.onmount()` every time your DOM changes. In this example, it's fired on DOM ready, on [Bootstrap events], and on [Turbolinks load].

  ```js
  $(function () { $.onmount() })
  $(document).on('show.bs closed.bs load page:change',
    function () { $.onmount() })
  ```

## API

* `$.onmount()`

  > Runs all behaviors.

* `$.onmount(selector)`

  > Runs all behaviors registered for `selector`.

* `$.onmount(selector, init())`

  > Registers a behavior for `selector` to run the callback `init()`.

* `$.onmount(selector, init(b), exit(b))`

  > Registers a behavior for `selector` to run the callback `init()`. The `exit()` callback will be called once the behavior is triggered again but the element is no longer attached to the DOM.
  >
  > The callbacks are passed an object `b`, and  the same object is passed for both `init` and `exit`. This allows them to communicate and keep aware of state.
  >
  > An ID is also provided, `b.id`, which is guaranteed unique for every behavior-element pair.

* `$.onmount.reset()`

  > Clears all defined behaviors. Useful for tests.
